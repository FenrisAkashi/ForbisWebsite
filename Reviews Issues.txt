Had to make an account for wordpress.org in order to get the widget to embed google reviews in real time.
username: forbistemp
password: yrjC(Nh&&WlzL&#5

...started looking like I needed to fully download wordpress, and maybe this was for wordpress websites only?

looking for another solution

tagembed looks good, but unable to find forbis auto detail. Would need to connect to the google account tied to the reviews directly. Also, may have to pay a monthly subscription to remove their branding and whatnot. Had to create another account for here already, used same username and password as above. 2000 views/month for free.

elfsight is similar to tagembed but cheaper. Signed up for a free account, again same username and password. Only 200 views a month for free... what happens when they hit 200??

Gave me this code to embed in my html:
<script src="https://apps.elfsight.com/p/platform.js" defer></script>
<div class="elfsight-app-f30df8fd-17bb-469e-a5db-54690b159745"></div>

This did work, but it shows extra stuff to the owner... Will have to see how it looks to others after it's fully operational. Noticeable lag/weirdness when the page comes up...

Another option, just have a button that goes to the google reviews page.

This youtuber literally did it all manually in html/css: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-QUBZuZlXM&ab_channel=Going-ToInternet 
Extremely last resort...

I think I found exactly what I needed to make the button option work, the direct url to the google reviews wanted:

CONFIRMED
