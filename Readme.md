home.html (main/landing page): Needs the quote button pop up form to actually submit an email.
about.html: Needs the quote button pop up form to actually submit an email.
services.html: Done unless services need to be changed or added.
gallery.html: Just need to have Forbis decide which ones should be removed if any.
reviews.html: Google reviews embeded using elfsight. Forbis paid for full year, on auto renewal w/his cc.
contact.html: Needs the quote button pop up form to actually submit an email. Removed the website with directions, kept original file in backup folder.
thankyou.html: Just needs to be connected to from the send message button once form submits.

Need to check all pages and functions on other browsers, and if possible on mobile devices. 

The quote button pop up form: I created a temp.html and thankyou.html page in an attempt to
figure out actually sending an email, however this was done using formsubmit.co and when I
tried to submit it had this error message: "UNABLE TO SUBMIT FORM - Make sure you open this
page through a web server, FormSubmit will not work in pages browsed as HTML files". So the
only way to know this is working, is to run it as an actual webpage. This may have to be
left for last if I cannot find an alternative that works using html files.
I might be able to take care of this using github pages:
