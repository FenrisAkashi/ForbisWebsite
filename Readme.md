The backup folder contains a version of the contact page with his address and a button that takes the user to google maps for directions. He doesn't want to use this feature until he is operating in a place that is not an apartment complex.

Changed index.html to home.html and rerouted default page in htaccess file to home.html. I was able to make urls not display .html at the end.



Reviews page info:
Google ID: ChIJQYVoDrqllVQRhWQ3AqC7j-8

Elfsight - $60/year (was able to get a coupon for first payment, set on auto renewal w/his card)

Gave me this code to embed in my html:
<script src="https://apps.elfsight.com/p/platform.js" defer></script>
<div class="elfsight-app-f30df8fd-17bb-469e-a5db-54690b159745"></div>

If he ever wants to switch to having a button linked to google reviews for free, the direct url to the google reviews wanted:
https://search.google.com/local/reviews?placeid=ChIJQYVoDrqllVQRhWQ3AqC7j-8

2/9/23: Found out that zooming in and out on phone messes up how it displays, at least on chrome. White space shows on the right side only after zooming in and then out again.
