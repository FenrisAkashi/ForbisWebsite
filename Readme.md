Resize images at: https://resizeimage.net/

home.html (main/landing page): Needs the quote button working
about.html: Needs the quote button working
services.html: Do we want the images to be clickable and become larger like in the gallery? I think they're fine. Perhaps resize so they are all the same dimensions?
gallery.html: Just needs all of the images resized to fit properly. Largest square proportions and then resize to 500 x 500 pixels.
reviews.html: Nothing done on this yet. Would like to be able to connect to google reviews and pull them in somehow.
contact.html: Need quote, call, and directions buttons to work.

Perhaps add his logo to all of the pages.
