home.html (main/landing page): Needs the quote button pop up form to actually submit an email.
about.html: Needs the quote button pop up form to actually submit an email.
services.html: Done unless services need to be changed or added.
gallery.html: Just need to have Forbis decide which ones should be removed if any.
reviews.html: Google reviews embeded using elfsight. Need to discuss options w/Forbis.
contact.html: Needs the quote button pop up form to actually submit an email.

Need to check all pages and functions on other browsers, and if possible on mobile devices. 

Perhaps add his logo to all of the pages.

The quote button pop up form: I created a temp.html and thankyou.html page in an attempt to
figure out actually sending an email, however this was done using formsubmit.co and when I
tried to submit it had this error message: "UNABLE TO SUBMIT FORM - Make sure you open this
page through a web server, FormSubmit will not work in pages browsed as HTML files". So the
only way to know this is working, is to run it as an actual webpage. This may have to be
left for last if I cannot find an alternative that works using html files.
I might be able to take care of this using github pages:

Tried to find the font of the logo without success. Can find similar fonts using: https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/

Might attempt a switch for users between light/dark mode. Not everyone likes dark mode.
