Wanted to make a separate app.js file for the script but it would no longer work.
Feeling like this may only work once the website is up and running, and for now need to have the script on each page it's needed.

Once it's online, try adding this line to the head section of the page:
<!--script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script-->

Then add this at the end of (inside of) the body section:
<!--script type="text/javascript" src="app.js"></script-->
