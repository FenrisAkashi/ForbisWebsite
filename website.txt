
What I've learned so far for website creation
domain registration is about $15/year, usually renewed annually, can maybe pay up to 10years in advance but not permanently.
web hosting, easiest when done w/same company as domain registration but can be transferred. Roughly $8/month.
There are hundreds of thousands of web hosting companies.
